## 🌀 Git Workflow Rules

1. **Update the [Work.md](./Work.md) file** — Let others know what you’re cooking so we don’t all reinvent the same wheel... or worse, merge over each other’s work.  
2. **Stay away from `main`** — Seriously. Don’t touch `main`. Don’t branch from it. Don’t merge into it. Pretend it’s radioactive. ☢️  
3. **Branch like a pro:**  
   - Start from `dev`.  
   - Name your branch `feature/your_name`.  
   - Example: `feature/alice_fix_broken_feature` (not `fixstuffpls123`).  
4. **When you’re done,** merge your magic into `dev`.  
5. **Before pushing,** check if someone else has been busy. If yes, resolve conflicts like a civilized human (not with `git push --force`).  
6. **Make a Pull Request** and proudly update [Work.md](./Work.md). Bonus points for a funny PR title.

## 📘 Documentation Rules

1. Write docs for every file you create. Imagine future-you trying to understand it without coffee. ☕  
2. If the function is simple enough, use **Doxygen comments** — they’re like Post-it notes for future developers.  
3. Keep it **Simple, Stupid.**

## 💻 Coding Rules

1. **C++ only.** (Python? Java? Go home.)  
2. Use **Doxygen comments** everywhere — it’s like giving your code subtitles.  
3. Format your code with **VSCode’s formatter** so we all look like one person with excellent style. ✨  
4. **Functions ≤ 50 lines.** If your function looks like *War and Peace*, split it up.  
5. **No public variables.** Use getters and setters — because encapsulation is sexy. 🕶️

> 💡 **Final Tip:**  
> Treat this repo like a shared kitchen. Clean up your mess, label your stuff, and don’t touch other people’s spaghetti code. 🍝
